# AI Agents Framework

An opinionated .NET framework, that is built on top of Semantic Kernel and Orleans, which helps creating and hosting event-driven AI Agents.

At the moment the library resides in `src/` only, but we plan to publish them as a Nuget Package in the future.

## Examples

We have created a few examples to help you get started with the framework and to explore its capabilities.

- [GitHub Dev Team Sample](samples/gh-flow/README.md): Build an AI Developer Team using event-driven agents, that help you automate the requirements engineering, planning, and coding process on GitHub.
- [Marketing Team Sample](samples/marketing/README.md): Create a marketing campaign using a content writer, graphic designer and social media manager.
